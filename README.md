# Neural_Networks-Clustering_Techniques


## Neural_Networks
Prediction of wind intensity with pre-trained deep neural network, implemented in Python 3.7 with Keras API and TensorFlow.

## Clustering_Techniques
The implementation of clustering algorithms in C++, for multidimensional vectors using 8 combinations: <br />
<br />
**Initialization:** <br />
1. Random selection of K points <br />
2. Kmeans++ <br />

**Assignment:** <br />
1. Lloyd's assignment (simplest approach) <br />
2. Assignment by Range Search with LSH <br />

**Update:** <br />
1. Partitioning Around Medoids (PAM) 'a la Lloyds
2. Mean Vector calculation
